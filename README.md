## Introduction

Numerical methods play a crucial role in approximating solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. This lab test project provides Java implementations of various numerical methods, making it a valuable resource for students and practitioners studying numerical analysis.

## Numerical Methods Implemented

The project includes the following numerical methods:

1. Bisection Method (Bisection.java)
2. False Position Method (FalsePosition.java)
3. Forward Interpolation (ForwardInterpolation.java)
4. Function Interface (Function.java)
5. Gauss Elimination Method (GaussElimination.java)
6. Gauss-Jordan Method (GaussJordan.java)
7. Lagrange Interpolation (LagrangeInterpolation.java)
8. Least Squares Method (LeastSquare.java)
9. Newton-Raphson Method (NewtonRaphson.java)
10. Newton's Divided Difference Method (NewtonsDividedDifference.java)
11. Point Class (Point.java)
12. Secant Method (Secant.java)
13. Simpson's Rule (Simpson.java)
14. Trapezoidal Rule (Trapezoidal_1.java, Trapezoidal_2.java)

Each class corresponds to a specific numerical method and can be used independently or in combination with others.

## Installation and Usage
